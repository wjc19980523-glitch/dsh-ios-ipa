//  DSHTurnPresence.h
//  DSH
//
//  iOS suspends an app that is not on screen, and the guest is threads inside
//  this process, so an agent turn does not continue while the user is somewhere
//  else. Today that is silent: the user switches away mid-turn, comes back, and
//  finds a conversation that stopped without saying why.
//
//  This does two things about it, neither of which is the real fix (turns that
//  resume where they left off, which is a change to the harness rather than to
//  the app):
//
//    - Asks iOS for the extra seconds it grants on the way out, so a step that
//      is already in flight — a capability call, an HTTP response being written
//      — finishes instead of being cut mid-write.
//    - Notices that a turn was in progress when the app left, and says so on
//      the way back, at the moment the user is looking at the stall and
//      wondering.
//
